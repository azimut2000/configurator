description "@WEBOS_PROJECT_SUMMARY@"

# activitymanager may crash or be stopped manually.  Need to re-register the activities
# in this case

# Need to make sure that AM doesn't hang when it emits it's upstart signal
# This is actually not safe, as it can cause upstart to eat the events.
# The Activity Manager will call the configurator directly.

start on activitymanager-ready

# The file cache & db kinds need to be configured first
